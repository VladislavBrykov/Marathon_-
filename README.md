# Marathon_C
First acquaintance with ะก. From introduction to basic knowledge. 1 month of hard learning.
Each Sprint or Race has a PDF with a detailed task and my solution.
At this point, I have no programming experience. And I don't know anything about the Xi language. This is my first experience. The 
training program is focused on a tough change in thinking. I study every day for 12-16 hours.
